  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Connecting the application to the device RadiaCode</span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Before starting to work with the device, make sure that the power of the device is turned on.</span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">When you start the application for the first time, it will automatically open <a href="https://docs.radiacode.com/EN/Android/11+Devices">device selection dialog</a>. You can connect to the device via Bluetooth and USB interfaces. To connect the device to a phone/tablet via USB, you need to use an On-The-Go (OTG) cable.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="opacity:1;">[!Warning] To connect the RadiaCode device to your smartphone via Bluetooth, you do not need to perform the device pairing procedure via your smartphone&#39;s Bluetooth settings. You do not need to enter any connection codes either.</span></p>

  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Tap the “Bluetooth” label. If Bluetooth is not enabled in y<span></span>our phone, the application will ask you to enable it. Confirm that you allow the app t<span style="margin-bottom:0px;margin-left:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-top:0px">o turn on Bluetooth. If your phone does not support Bluetooth version 4.0 (Android OS version is less than 6), a corresponding message will be displayed. The device cannot be operated with such a telephone via the Bluetooth interface.</span></span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Additionally, the app requires location access permission to function. This is a requirement of the Android OS to work with Bluetooth Low Energy.</span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Soon, the device name will appear in the “Choose device” field. “RadiaCode-10X”. This means that the application has found the device via the Bluetooth interface. Detection may take some time. Leave the “Remember selected device” checkbox enabled, and subsequently the application will connect with the device automatically. If the application does not find the device for a long time, try following [[3 If the application cannot find the device...|these recommendations]].</span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Tap the “OK” button at the bottom of the screen. Will open app home screen [[4 Main Screen|app home screen]]. Communication with the device will be established and the device will be initialized, which will take a few seconds.<img src="assets/images/initdevice1.png" /> </span></p>
  <p><span style="opacity:1;">Once initialized, the application will continuously receive data from the device, even if there is another application in the foreground. The activity of the application is indicated by the icon in the notification area of t?he phone/tablet:<img src="assets/images/notificon.png" /></span></p>
